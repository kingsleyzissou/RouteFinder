# RouteFinder
Game of Thrones route finder 

The application is designed to find the 3 shortest path between two towns on a map of Game of Thrones. 
The app takes in an input of towns from a user, the desired waypoints and towns to avoid. The user also has the choice between
finding the easiest route, the shortest route and the safest route.

The requirement of the project was to construct a custom graph data structure and implement Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
Additionally, the system uses Yen's k-Shortest Paths algorithm to provide the user with the 3 best routes.
